# FBR25-Electronics

## Creating a PCB Project

1. Create a new respository, using the template, by going to [the template repository](https://github.com/Full-Blue-Racing/ElectronicsProjectTemplate), and pressing "Use This Template"

2. Clone your repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/Full-Blue-Racing/<project name>`.

3. Create the `generated` directory inside the repository. This should not be and doesn't need to be committed to GitHub.

4. Create a new KiCad project inside the repository, ensuring to uncheck "Create a new folder for the project".

## Submitting for Manufacturing

Once your project is complete, you can submit your PCB for review, and once we've checked it over it will be sent to be manufactured with the next batch of PCBs we order.

1. Create a release on GitHub.
   Ensure you've pushed all of your changes, then follow [Creating a Release](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository#creating-a-release).
   You should also export the Gerbers for your PCB, and a Bill of Materials, and upload these to the release page.

2. Submit your release [here](https://forms.gle/mBnbXawvQiZjMk937).

3. Once reviewed, we will also add your PCB into the main Loom schematic.
